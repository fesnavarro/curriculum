{OPEN SOURCE - Addicted Researcher}
{}
{}
{I was always someone involved with systems information, but 6 years ago
	when I decided to turn to Linux (Unix like) I became an absolute fan of
	open source projects, since then I immersed myself and I remain attentive
	to all types of projects that appear on the repositories. Whenever possible,
	I use my free time to test scripts and set up various infrastructures that
	may one day be important in some real project. I spent so much time looking
	through terminals (bash, sh, zsh) that even using editors (e.g. ATOM) or IDE
	(e.g. VSCode), I still need to put them in VIM mode, even in the browser I feel
	more comfort using a VIM mode extension}

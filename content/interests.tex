{I was always someone involved with systems information, but 6 years ago when I decided to turn to Linux (Unix like) I became an absolute fan of open source projects, since then I immersed myself and I remain attentive to all types of projects that appear on the repositories. Whenever possible, I use my free time to test scripts and set up various infrastructures that may one day be important in some real project.}

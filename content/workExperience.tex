{\cvlist{
		\item Automation from scratch of a painting line with KTL technology
		at Randon Implementos (Caxias do Sul), automation included elements such as Elipse (SCADA)
		superviser system, 4 HMI, local reading in OPCUA by a python client, storage and exposure by https
		for consumption in infrastructure using Grafana in the exhibition
		\item Using an ESP32 (with more internal resources than an Arduino) for local collection
		and transmission, in addition to a RapsberryPI as a consumer gateway for the external
		server API. The integration of the Welding Maintenance Team (General Welding Maintenance - SCS)
		to the ERP Odoo system was resolved in the process, including integrations such as point
		control and automated QRCode reading of the equipment with the ERP

		international articles as being a pioneer in applying several technologies
		together
		\item I coordinated a massive migration from General Motors (SCS) to General Motors (SJC) plants
		in partnership with Tyssen Krupp, in this project I even defined the
		electrical shutdowns and executed the new start-up in the new plant, the
		project was perfect and almost no application changes were necessary,
		except for integrations between the robotic cells and the local network
		\item In response to a call from Eisemman for automation at MAN (Resende),
		I alone made all the necessary changes for the operation of the Carese
		painting line, with more than 200 conveyors, elevators, transfer tables and
